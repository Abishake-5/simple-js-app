This is a simple application used to display different types of pokemon and give it's information such as name, weight, height and image. It's done through an api using mainly JS. Then html and css are used to display and style these pokemons. It's also made to be responsive in different devices and different browser versions using bootstrap and polyfills. Lastly eslintrc and prettier are used to make sure the coding style is consistent throughout the file while also making sure the file size is at the loweset using minifiers.
